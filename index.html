        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Checkboxes are a common user interface component, but their usability
          and accessibility can vary across different applications. In this case
          study, I analyzed how checkboxes and their labels function in three
          different applications and evaluating their interactivity, keyboard
          navigation, and accessibility for different users. Then, I created
          state models that illustrate how users navigate checkboxes in their
          current form and propose a redesigned version of one application's
          implementation. I hope to emphasize the importance that small UI
          changes can make and challenge my own ways of thinking about common UI
          components! A few general notes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My laptop's screenshot feature did not display my cursor, so I have
            included pictures of what the cursors look like and describe them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I use a Thinkpad X14 Carbon and an iPhone 14 for the mobile
            versions. For my laptop browser, I use Google Chrome, and mobile
            browser, I use Safari.
          </li>
          <li>
            I use the word "toggle" to describe the checking or unchecking of a
            checkbox.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 1: Input</h2>
        <p>
          I chose to examine three applications that I often use that have
          checkboxes - Google Forms, the Microsoft To-dos application, and the
          in-game settings for the video game Hades. When interacting with a
          checkbox, inputs refer to the different ways a user can engage with
          the component, such as clicking with a mouse, using keyboard
          shortcuts, or tapping on a touchscreen. In this section, I explored
          how users interact with these applications' checkboxes across mouse,
          keyboard, and mobile inputs.

          <tr>
            <th>Interaction Type</th>
            <th>Observations</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mouse/Touchpad</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Clicking anywhere on the answer text also toggles the checkbox
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can also click beyond the answer text - as long as you
                  click within the question "box" in line with a checkbox
                  option/its text, it will check the box.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Long-clicking on an option (including the checkbox, the text,
                  or the "line" that the checkbox and text are on) only triggers
                  the toggle when you release.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because it toggles on release, clicking and dragging to
                  highlight text automatically toggles or toggles the checkbox,
                  making text toggles a little awkward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can also click beyond the answer text - as long as you
                  click within the question "box" in line with a checkbox
                  option/its text, it will toggle.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Keyboard</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tab navigation works, but once you tab past a checkbox, you
                  have to cycle through every element on the form to go back.
                  You can't use arrow keys to move to the next option.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something I noticed was that using the down arrow for
                  checkboxes doesn't work and instead will scroll the page
                  downwards, but for single-choice questions (a circle instead
                  of a box), the arrow keys do change focus of the answer
                  choices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pressing spacebar toggles but Enter does nothing. Holding the
                  spacebar rapidly toggles the checkbox.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mobile</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can't really hover on mobile so the indicator doesn't show
                  up until you press a box.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like on computer, clicking the space in line with the checkbox
                  (whether it's the text or the space after the text) will
                  toggle the checkbox. This makes it a little harder to ensure
                  your touch will toggle the option you intended.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Microsoft To-Do Checkboxes</h3>
        <p>
          I am going to refer to each checkbox item as a task since that is what
          the application refers to them as. Note that I chose to use the
          browser version since the app would not download for me. I also wanted
          to better compare it to Google Form checkboxes, which were also in a
          browser. A few general observations across all devices/interfaces:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are visual separations between each "item" - each item is
            bounded by a rectangle that is a different color than the
            background.
          </li>
          <li>
            The checkbox is shaped like a circle, rather than the typical
            square. I will still be referring to it as a checkbox.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Interaction Type</th>
            <th>Observations</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mouse</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you click anywhere on the task that isn't the checkbox
                  itself, it does not mark the task as completed but rather
                  opens up a sidebar with task details. Only clicking on the
                  checkbox will mark it as completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You cannot select text on the task - clicking and dragging
                  instead allows you to move where the task is located in the
                  list. However, this drag and drop option is not an option for
                  mobile or keyboard users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clicking on a task highlights the task even when you exit out
                  of the sidebar of task details that pops up, allowing the user
                  to see what task they last viewed the details of.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right clicking a task pulls up a dropdown menu with various
                  options for the task, like editing, deleting, etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Keyboard</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can tab through individual “components” of a task - the
                  task itself, the checkbox, the text, the star button. If you
                  press space or enter on the checkbox then it checks off the
                  task, and if you press enter on the text itself it opens up
                  the sidebar. However, if you press enter on the text itself it
                  opens up the sidebar to edit the task details, but you can’t
                  press enter again to exit and have to press tab.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No matter where your focus is on the task (checkbox, star,
                  text, etc.), if you press the down or up arrow, it takes you
                  to the next task.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since right-clicking was an option in this application, I
                  tried to find a way to right-click but failed. Google told me
                  it was Shift-F10 but that brought up the actual right click
                  menu and not the task dropdown options.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You cannot tab through each task on the list - you can tab
                  onto one task and once you finish getting through the
                  components of that task (star, checkbox, label), the focus
                  doesn't move to the next task - it disappears.
                </li>
                <li>I could not find a way to reorder tasks.</li>
              </ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mobile</td>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can’t drag and drop tasks - when you long-click, it opens
                  up the right-click dropdown, which means that you can’t move
                  the order of my tasks around like on laptop.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The checkboxes are also quite small on mobile, and since you
                  can only check off a task by clicking the tiny circle, it
                  makes it a little awkward to use.
                </li>

        <h3>Hades Settings Checkboxes</h3>
        <p>
          One thing I noticed about these settings was that there was a Reset
          option, which resets all checkboxes to their default settings.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can hover directly on either a setting's text or the box -
                  it doesn’t register as “hovered” if your mouse is just nearby
                  one of the two, which is different from Google Forms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you long-click a button, the toggle occurs on click, but on
                  mobile, it toggles on release.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Instead of using tab to switch between options, you can use
                  the WASD or arrow keys—this is typical for gaming and WASD are
                  the in-game movement controls. Since each key represents a
                  direction, you can use the keys to move the focus to another
                  option respective to that direction—for example, to move focus
                  to the checkbox to the right, you would press the D or right
                  arrow key.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spacebar and Enter check and uncheck the boxes. You cannot
                  toggle multiple options at once.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you first begin keyboard focus, you start at the leftmost
                  column of the checkbox options and keep shifting down until
                  you get to the Reset button, so you have to press multiple
                  keys to get through every checkbox. Typically, you assume that
                  one key gets you through all the options.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you press the down arrow from Bright Cursor or Screen
                  Shake, it takes you to Reset, but not Transmit Data. The Arrow
                  key movements are just generally inconsistent—depending on
                  where your checkbox is located in the layout, pressing the
                  same key might do different things.
                </li>

                  ensure you’re tapping the right setting, especially since the
                  phone screen is small.

        <p>
          Outputs, on the other hand, are how the interface responds to the
          user's input interactions, such as visual changes (color changes,
          highlights), auditory feedback (sound effects), or focus indicators
          for accessibility. In this section, I examined the feedback provided
          by each application and how it communicates the current state of a

                  When tabbed onto a checkbox option, it has the same focus
                  indicator as the mouse hover (a faint circle around the box) –
                  no additional indicators.

                  finished tabbing through the rest of the checkbox options.

                  When clicking the task's checkbox (marking it as completed), a

                  The animation is quite short and often glitches, so the only

                  The focus order is odd – it starts with the entire task, then

                  itself, then to the star, and then the focus indicator

        <h2>Part 3: State Models & Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          Based on my observations from Google Forms, Microsoft To-Do, and Hades
          Settings, I identified a few areas that I wanted to improve regarding
          how checkboxes function across these applications. This case study
          specifically will address potential improvements that can be made for
          Google Forms checkboxes. Before redesigning, however, I first created
          state models to show how users currently interact with the checkboxes
          - the available states of the components and the interactions that
          change those states.
